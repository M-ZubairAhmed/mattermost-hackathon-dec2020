### Mattermost Weather Plugin

Adds the ability to get the current conditions to Mattermost using the `/weather` command. Displays current conditions, temperature, barometric pressure, wind gust, precipitation type and amount, cloud cover, and a current precipitation map for the general area. Currently uses US units but eventually this will be configurable.
